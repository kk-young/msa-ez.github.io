<h2>example project</h2>

The example project is the process of creating a Java Project running with Spring-boot by EventStoring two services, an order service and a delivery service, and automatically deploying them to Kubernetes in Google Cloud.

## UI Introduce

<h3>UI layout</h3>

Here's the full screen layout of the MSAEZ tool.

## Build

### ·	Download file structure description

  - A project is created by the name (Order, Delivery) set in Bounded Context, and when the c-compression is unpacked, it has the following structure.

  - ![](../../src/img/image52.png)

  - gateway is a provided template and shows how to configure spring-cloud-gateway. For normal use, you need to modify the routes part in the application.yaml file of gateway/src/main/resource and use it.

  - The file structure was created according to the basic template for each sticker as shown below. It is a spring-boot-based project and manages resources with maven.
If you want to change the file creation location or the basic contents of the file every time you create it, you can use the custom template in the next chapter.

> ![스크린샷%202019-11-28%20오후%2012](../../src/img/image53.png)

  - application.yaml
    
      - It is a configuration file of spring-boot, and the local environment variable and Docker environment variable are separated by profile setting.

    
      - Because it is event-based, the spring-cloud-stream library is used for message processing. Among them, the broker is set up using kafka.


  - Dockerfile   
      - This file is required when creating a Docker image.

      - When building with Docker, "--spring.profiles.active=docker" is set, so the profile set in the application.yaml file is read.


  - cloudbuild.yaml
    
      - This is a pipeline file used by Google Cloud Build.
    
      - By default, the test-build-docker build-publish-deploy step is set.
    
      - The Docker publish step deploys the image to Google Container Registry (GCR).
    
      - In the Deploy stage, you deploy to GKE. At this point, you need to set the cluster name and Zone. The following 3 items must be changed according to the user.
        
          - The substitutions._PROJECT_NAME: item determines which service and deploy name to deploy, and you need to change the corresponding part.
        
          - CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE: The set Zone is set to Tokyo (asia-northeast1-a).
        
          - CLOUDSDK_CONTAINER_CLUSTER: The cluster name is standard-cluster-1, which is the default cluster name.


<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

  - maven install

  - run local kafka - localhost:9092

### ·	Execution

  - Since it is a Maven project, run it with mvn spring-boot:run .

  - If it runs normally, write localhost:8081 (port is different for each project, refer to the configuration file) in the browser to check whether the property values set in Aggregate are displayed normally at HATEOAS level.

  - Check if methods such as get and post written in Command are called successfully.

### ·	Cloud deployment

This guide shows how to automatically build and deploy the working source code by uploading it to github and creating a GCB trigger.

### ·	Git integration

  - GCB supports git repository, github, google code, and bitbucket so far. This guide explains how to put the code on github in two ways.

  - [<span class="underline">https://github.com/</span>](https://github.com/)
    Create a repository at

  - A repository is created and a git address is created.

  - Push the source to github by executing the script below in the project you want to upload to github.

  - git init

  - git commit –m ‘commit message’ .

  - git push \<github address\>

### ·	Create GCB Trigger

GCB trigger generation proceeds in the following order.


1. Enter the GCB menu of GCP and click the trigger menu.
> ![](../../src/img/image54.png)
2. Click the Connect Repository button at the top.
> ![](../../src/img/image55.png)
3. Select github in Connect Repository.
> ![](../../src/img/image56.png)
4. Proceed with github authentication.
> ![](../../src/img/image57.png)
5. Finalize the repository connection by selecting the project to connect to.
> ![](../../src/img/image58.png)
6. Click the Create Trigger button at the top to create a trigger.
> ![](../../src/img/image59.png)
7. At the bottom of the trigger creation screen, choose CloudBuild as the build configuration.
>![](../../src/img/image60.png)
8. Click the Create Trigger button to complete the trigger creation. Trigger execution can be done directly with the trigger execution button on the right. 
> ![](../../src/img/image61.png)

If you create a trigger as above, you can check that the trigger works whenever you execute the push command on github.

### ·	Deploy Kubernetes

### ·	Check your Kubernetes deployment

  - If the trigger is executed without any issues, you can check the build success/failure in the history menu.

> ![](../../src/img/image62.png)

  - If a green success screen appears in the build history, it means that it has been successfully deployed to GKE. You can check the currently running services in the Workloads item of the GKE menu.

> ![](../../src/img/image63.png)

### ·	What to do when deployment fails

* n the case of build failure, build failure appears in red as shown below in the history item, and when clicked, it is possible to check in which step the error occurred. It can be resolved while checking the detailed log by clicking the log download button.

> ![](../../src/img/image64.png)

> ![](../../src/img/image65.png)

* If an error occurs in the deploy step, first check whether you have permission to deploy from GCB to GKE, and if not, set the permission.

> Cloud Build – In the Settings menu, check if the status is Kubernetes Engine Developer Enabled, and if not, enable it.

> ![](../../src/img/image66.png)

* Verify that the name matches the cluster zone in the option part of the cloudBuild.yaml file.

<pre class=" language-yaml">

options :  
    env:  
    ## location/name of GKE cluster (used by all kubectl commands)  
    - CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE=asia-northeast1-a  
    - CLOUDSDK_CONTAINER_CLUSTER=standard-cluster-1
    
</pre>
