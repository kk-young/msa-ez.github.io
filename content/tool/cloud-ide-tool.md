### Event storming.

**Click the Practice button at the top of the page to access the practice site.**

- After connecting, click the image or CREATE button of EventStorming.
![](../../src/img/cloud-ide-tool/17.png)

<br>

**Draw an example event storming by dragging a sticker from the palette on the left.**

- For instructions on the tool, see the left menu -> Tool Usage -> Event Storming.
![](../../src/img/cloud-ide-tool/18.png)

<br>

**Click Code Preview that pops up when you mouse over the CODE or CODE in the upper right corner.**

- You can check the code for the generated event storming.
![](../../src/img/cloud-ide-tool/19.png)

<br>

**You can check after switching to various languages through the mode at the top right of the Code Preview window.**
![](../../src/img/cloud-ide-tool/20.png)

<br>

### Use IDE

<br>

**Now, click Project ID after mouse over the CODE in the event storming window.**
![](../../src/img/cloud-ide-tool/21.png)

<br>

**You can see that the IDE of the Web version appears like this.**
- Basically, environments such as docekr, kubernetes, and http are built into.
- If you have other tools you need, you can download them by downloading them from Linux.
![](../../src/img/cloud-ide-tool/22.png)

<br>

- Docker
![](../../src/img/cloud-ide-tool/23.png)

<br>

- Kubernetes
![](../../src/img/cloud-ide-tool/24.png)

<br>

- Http
![](../../src/img/cloud-ide-tool/25.png)

<br>



**Let's check if the message from the order service is normally registered on the Kafka server and a delivery console that acts as a consumer.**
- 1. Click Start Kafka Server in Labs on the top menu to run the Kafka server.
  - You can check the message that the Kafka server ran normally in the lower right corner.
![](../../src/img/cloud-ide-tool/29.png)

<br>

- 2. Click Kafka Consumer in Labs on the top menu.
![](../../src/img/cloud-ide-tool/26.png)

<br>

- 3. Topic's name is the same as the project name of event storming.
![](../../src/img/cloud-ide-tool/27.png)

<br>

- 4. Click Kafka Consumer -> Write the Project Name with one space behind the generated command.

### Service execution.
**Move to the order's root to register the order service.**
- Run the spring boot server using the mvn spring-boot:run command.

```javascript
mvn spring-boot:run
```

![](../../src/img/cloud-ide-tool/30.png)

<br>

- You can see that the order service appeared on port8081.
![](../../src/img/cloud-ide-tool/31.png)

<br>

- Let me check at the new terminal to see if the order service is accessible.
- You can normally access the order service by applying the command below using http.
- We approached localhost:8081/orders because the path of src/main/java/project/orderRepository.java is the order and the order service is marked as port8081.
```javascript
http localhost:8081/orders
```

![](../../src/img/cloud-ide-tool/32.png)

<br>

- If you put the values of customerId=1, qty=3, and productId=1 in the order, you can see that localhost:8081/orders contain the values normally.
```javascript
http localhost:8081/orders customerId=1 qty=3 productId=1
```

![](../../src/img/cloud-ide-tool/33.png)

<br>

- When you place an order, you can see that the topic has been added where you executed the topic command.
